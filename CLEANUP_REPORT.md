# Project Cleanup and Preparation Report

## Summary of the Main Problem

The project contained obsolete browser profile data from a previous, faulty browser implementation. These profiles were large, unnecessary, and tightly coupled with the browser management logic, making the code difficult to maintain and extend.

## Deleted Directories and Files

The following directories and files were deleted to remove the obsolete browser artifacts and junk files:

-   `src/profiles/agent_profile`
-   `src/profiles/agent_profile_codex`
-   `devrevie`

## Refactoring of `src/browser.ts`

The browser management logic in `src/browser.ts` was refactored to remove hardcoded dependencies on the deleted profile directories.

### Summary of Changes:

-   Removed the logic that automatically creates a `_codex` suffixed profile directory if the primary one is locked.
-   The browser launch logic now defaults to creating a temporary browser profile if the configured one is unavailable.
-   Added comments to clarify the new, more generic browser launch logic.

This change decouples the browser management from specific profile paths, making it more robust and configurable for future development.

## Linter and Formatter Execution

The `eslint` linter and `prettier` code formatter were successfully executed on all `.ts`, `.tsx`, and `.js` files within the `src/` directory. This ensures that the codebase adheres to a consistent style and quality standard.

## Conclusion

The project has been successfully cleaned and prepared for the next phase of development. All obsolete browser artifacts have been removed, the browser management logic has been refactored, and the codebase has been standardized. The project is now in a clean, stable, and maintainable state.
