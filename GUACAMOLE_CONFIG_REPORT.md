# Guacamole Configuration Report

## 1. Summary

Apache Guacamole has been successfully configured to provide visual access to the browser agent's VNC server. This enables real-time monitoring and debugging of the agent's browser, which is a critical capability for testing and development.

## 2. `user-mapping.xml` Configuration

The file `infra/guacamole/user-mapping.xml` has been created. It defines a user named `xagent-admin` with the password `password`. This user is authorized to connect to a VNC session named "Browser Agent Desktop," which points to the `browser-agent` container (`hostname: browser-agent`) on the standard VNC port (`5900`).

## 3. VNC Password Synchronization

The VNC server password in the browser agent's startup script, `services/browser-agent/start.sh`, has been synchronized with the password in the `user-mapping.xml` file. The `x11vnc` command now uses the `-passwd password` argument to ensure successful authentication from Guacamole.

## 4. Conclusion

The system is now fully configured for end-to-end testing. The user can now run `docker-compose up --build` and follow the instructions in the `README.md` to visually verify the entire workflow.
