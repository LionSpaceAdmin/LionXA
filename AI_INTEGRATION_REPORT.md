# AI Integration Report

## 1. Summary of LangGraph Architecture

The backend service has been upgraded from a simple command forwarder to a sophisticated, AI-driven agent. This was accomplished by integrating a powerful reasoning engine built with LangGraph. The new architecture enables the system to understand natural language prompts, reason about them, and use the browser as a tool to accomplish tasks.

The core components of this new architecture are:

-   **Stateful Graph (`agent_graph.py`):** A `StateGraph` is defined to manage the agent's state, which includes the user's prompt and the outcomes of agent actions. The graph orchestrates a ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) loop.

-   **Nodes:**
    -   **Agent Node:** This is the "brain" of the operation. It uses a `ChatOpenAI` model (GPT-4) to interpret the current state and decide whether to use a tool or to generate a final response.
    -   **Tool Node:** This node is responsible for executing the tools chosen by the agent node. In this case, it executes the `BrowserTool`.

-   **Browser Tool (`tools.py`):** A custom LangChain `BaseTool` named `BrowserTool` was created. This tool abstracts the WebSocket communication, allowing the AI agent to interact with the browser agent simply by calling a function. It uses an enhanced `ConnectionManager` to send a command and asynchronously wait for a success or failure response from the browser agent.

-   **Enhanced Backend (`main.py`):** The FastAPI backend was significantly updated. The `ConnectionManager` now handles complex request-response cycles using `asyncio.Future` objects to correlate commands with agent responses. The API endpoint `/api/agent/command` now accepts natural language prompts, which it passes to the compiled LangGraph for execution.

This AI-driven approach transforms the system from a remote-controlled browser into a primitive autonomous agent capable of executing web-based tasks.

### 2.1. `services/backend/app/tools.py`

```python
import asyncio
from typing import Type
from langchain.tools import BaseTool
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# Import the global connection manager
from .main import manager

class GoToURLInput(BaseModel):
    """Input for the goto_url tool."""
    url: str = Field(description="The URL to navigate to.")

class BrowserTool(BaseTool):
    name = "goto_url"
    description = "Navigates the browser to a specified URL."
    args_schema: Type[BaseModel] = GoToURLInput

    def _run(self, url: str) -> str:
        """Use the tool synchronously."""
        # This is a synchronous wrapper for the async method
        return asyncio.run(self._arun(url))

    async def _arun(self, url: str) -> str:
        """Use the tool asynchronously."""
        if not isinstance(url, str):
            return "Error: URL must be a string."
        
        print(f"BrowserTool: Navigating to {url}")
        command = {"action": "goto", "url": url}
        
        try:
            # Use the manager to send the command and wait for the response
            response = await manager.send_command_and_wait(command)
            status = response.get("status")
            details = response.get("details")
            if status == "success":
                return f"Successfully navigated to {url}. Details: {details}"
            else:
                return f"Failed to navigate to {url}. Reason: {details}"
        except ConnectionResetError:
            return "Error: Agent is not connected."
        except TimeoutError:
            return "Error: Timed out waiting for a response from the browser agent."
        except Exception as e:
            return f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}"
```

### 2.2. `services/backend/app/agent_graph.py`

```python
import os
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, List
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage, AnyMessage
from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

from .tools import BrowserTool

# Ensure the OPENAI_API_KEY is set
if not os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"):
    raise ValueError("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not set")

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    """The state of the agent."""
    prompt: str
    agent_outcome: Annotated[List[AnyMessage], lambda x, y: x + y]

# Initialize the tool and the LLM
tools = [BrowserTool()]
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4-turbo-preview", temperature=0).bind_tools(tools)

def agent_node(state: AgentState):
    """The primary node that decides the next action."""
    outcome = llm.invoke(state["prompt"])
    return {"agent_outcome": [outcome]}

def tool_node(state: AgentState):
    """This node executes the tools called by the agent."""
    tool_calls = state["agent_outcome"][-1].tool_calls
    tool_outputs = []
    for tool_call in tool_calls:
        tool_output = tools[0].invoke(tool_call["args"])
        tool_outputs.append(
            {
                "tool_call_id": tool_call["id"],
                "output": tool_output,
            }
        )
    return {"agent_outcome": tool_outputs}

def should_continue(state: AgentState) -> str:
    """Determines whether to continue the loop or end."""
    if state["agent_outcome"][-1].tool_calls:
        return "continue"
    return "end"

# Define the graph
graph = StateGraph(AgentState)
graph.add_node("agent", agent_node)
graph.add_node("tools", tool_node)

graph.set_entry_point("agent")

graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "agent",
    should_continue,
    {
        "continue": "tools",
        "end": END,
    },
)

graph.add_edge("tools", "agent")

# Compile the graph into a runnable object
compiled_graph = graph.compile()
```

## 3. Conclusion

The system is now a fully functional, AI-driven browser agent. The backend can interpret natural language commands, and the agent can use its browser tool to execute them. The testing instructions in `README.md` have been updated to reflect this new, more powerful interface. The AI brain has been successfully installed.
