# Browser Integration Report

## Summary of the Integration Process

A new, modern internal browser system was integrated into the application using the Playwright library. The old, problematic browser logic was replaced with a new, modular `BrowserService` that manages the browser lifecycle in a clean, configurable, and maintainable way.

## New `browserService.ts` Module

The core of the new implementation is the `src/browserService.ts` module. This module exports a singleton instance of the `BrowserService` class, which is responsible for:

-   Initializing a browser instance of a specified type (Chromium, Firefox, or WebKit).
-   Providing new browser pages to the application.
-   Gracefully closing the browser instance.
-   Reading its configuration from the central `src/config.ts` file.

This new service decouples the browser management from the main application logic, making the code more robust and easier to maintain.

## Integration with `src/browser.ts`

The old browser logic in `src/browser.ts` was completely removed and replaced with a simple export of the new `browserService` singleton. This ensures that the entire application now uses the new, modern browser system.

### Key Changes:

-   The old `ensureSession` and `getSingleton` functions were removed.
-   The file now simply exports the `browserService` instance.

## Verification Script

A verification script, `scripts/verifyBrowser.ts`, was created to ensure that the new browser system works correctly. The script initializes the browser service, navigates to `https://www.google.com`, and takes a screenshot.

A new script, `"verify:browser"`, was added to `package.json` to execute this verification script. The script was run successfully, confirming that the new browser system is operational.

## Conclusion

The new internal browser system has been successfully integrated into the application. The new implementation is more robust, maintainable, and configurable than the old one, and it provides a solid foundation for all future browser-related tasks. The project is now ready for the next phase of development.
