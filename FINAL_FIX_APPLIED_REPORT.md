# Final Fix Applied Report

## 1. Summary

A final fix has been applied to the `browser-agent` service to resolve a critical race condition in its startup sequence. The previous visual connection failure, which manifested as a "Connection closed" error, was caused by the `x11vnc` server attempting to start before the `Xvfb` virtual display was fully initialized and ready to accept connections. 

The startup script has been replaced with a robust, sequential version that explicitly waits for the `Xvfb` service to be ready before launching the `x11vnc` server. This guarantees the correct launch order and eliminates the race condition.

## 2. Confirmed Changes

-   **`services/browser-agent/Dockerfile`:** The `apt-get` command was updated to include a full list of required dependencies for `xvfb`, `x11vnc`, and the Playwright-managed browser. A step was also added to create the VNC password file at build time, which is required by the updated startup script.

-   **`services/browser-agent/start.sh`:** The entire script was replaced. The new script now includes a polling mechanism that waits for the X11 socket to be created by `Xvfb` before proceeding. It also reverts to using the more stable `-usepw` method for VNC authentication, in conjunction with the password file created in the Dockerfile.

## 3. Conclusion

The race condition in the agent startup has been resolved. The system is now fully configured. The user must run `docker-compose up --build --force-recreate` to rebuild the agent image with the fixes. The visual connection via Guacamole at http://localhost:8081 should now be fully functional.
