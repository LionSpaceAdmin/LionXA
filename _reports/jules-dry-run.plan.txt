# Jules "Hello" Dry Run (Plan Only)
Date: 2025-09-22
Requested by: LionSpaceAdmin
Repository: danielions/LionXA

## Requested Task
Propose a minor documentation refinement in README (no code changes). Run in plan-only mode to verify Jules can authenticate, clone, and outline steps without modifying the repo.

## Expected Plan (from automation run)
1. Clone repo with `pnpm` workspace support and respect `.nvmrc`.
2. Execute `bash scripts/setup.sh` to mirror CI (install → clean → build → lint → typecheck → test).
3. Inspect README for outdated setup instructions; draft update suggestion.
4. Report status with zero file diffs and highlight required next steps for a full task.

## Status
- ❌ Not yet executed: Jules access pending final authorization & branch protection verification.
- ✅ Pre-checks available: setup script + CI workflow already green locally (see `_reports/setup-summary.txt`).

## Next Steps
- Once Jules app authorization is confirmed, trigger a plan-only run via Google Jules console using the above prompt.
- Archive the resulting JSON/markdown plan here to close this checklist item.
