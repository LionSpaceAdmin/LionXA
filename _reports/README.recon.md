# Reconnaissance Report

This report provides an executive summary of the repository reconnaissance.

## Overview

A full reconnaissance of the repository was performed to map all files, configurations, dependencies, and scripts. The goal was to detect inconsistencies and generate structured reports to establish a clean baseline before production hardening.

## Key Findings

*   **Secrets:** Potential secrets were found in the codebase.
*   **Code Hygiene:** The project has a mix of JavaScript and TypeScript files, and potentially orphaned files.
*   **Dependencies:** A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and dependency graph have been generated.
*   **Configuration:** A report of all configuration files has been generated.
*   **Scripts:** All npm scripts have been collected and validated.
*   **Git State:** A report on the current git state has been generated.

## Recommendations

It is recommended to address the high-priority issues first, starting with the removal of secrets from the repository. Following that, the code hygiene issues should be addressed to improve the maintainability of the codebase.

All generated reports can be found in the `_reports` directory.
