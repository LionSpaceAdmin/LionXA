# Diagnostics Report

This report summarizes the findings from the repository reconnaissance.

## High Priority

*   **Secrets found in the repository:** The secrets audit identified potential secrets stored in the codebase. These should be removed and managed through a secure secret management system. Refer to `_reports/secrets-audit.md` for details.
*   **Mixed JS/TS files:** The project contains directories with a mix of JavaScript and TypeScript files. This can lead to inconsistencies and make the codebase harder to maintain. Consider migrating all JavaScript files to TypeScript. Refer to `_reports/project-hygiene-report.json` for a list of directories.

## Medium Priority

*   **Orphaned files:** The project hygiene scan identified potentially orphaned files that are not imported by any other file. These should be reviewed and removed if they are no longer needed. Refer to `_reports/project-hygiene-report.json` for a list of files.
*   **Large files:** The file scan identified several large files in the repository. These could impact performance and should be reviewed. Consider if they can be optimized or moved to a different storage solution. Refer to `_reports/inventory.json` for a list of large files.

## Low Priority

*   **Duplicate files:** The file scan identified several duplicate files. While not critical, removing duplicates can help to keep the codebase clean. Refer to `_reports/inventory.json` for a list of duplicate files.
