# IDX Environment Updated for Docker Support

## 1. Summary of Changes

The `.idx/dev.nix` configuration file has been updated to include the Docker and Docker Compose packages and to enable the Docker daemon service. This was a necessary step to allow `docker` commands to run within the workspace.

## 2. CRITICAL NEXT STEP: Reload the Environment

The changes to the environment configuration will **not** take effect until you reload the workspace.

-   **Action Required:** Click the command menu (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+P on Linux/Windows) and search for **"Reload IDX"**. Select it to restart the environment with the new Docker configuration.

-   After the environment has finished reloading, the Docker service will be active.

## 3. Proceed with Diagnostics

Once the environment has been reloaded, you can now re-run your `docker compose up` command, and it should execute successfully.
